##### about me

Hi there! I’m Shivam, aka Tangy, and I’m from Mauritius! (but I’ll keep exactly where a secret!). 
I’m a tech lover who’s always tinkering with Android, Windows, Linux, and web stuff. I know some basic HTML and CSS, and I’m pretty handy with tools like WordPress. 
I like making cool, functional websites—not for commissions, though. It’s just a hobby to learn, have fun, and sometimes kill time. I'm not really a developer but rather someone who enjoys learning and doing new things. 
I’m also a gamer! I play Genshin Impact, Minecraft, Roblox, and Among Us. If you’re looking for a gaming buddy, I’m your person! 
I also post on YouTube, TikTok, and socials, but only when I feel like it—so yeah, my socials are more “chill” than active. ;) 
Check out [this link](https://beacons.ai/mrug_tangy) to find my socials, the communities I manage, and more about me. 
Need someone to talk to or advice on life stuff? Hit me up in DMs—I’m happy to help however I can!
